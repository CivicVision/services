We are happy to announce the new CKAN Extensions Registry which lists available CKAN Extensions:

<h2><a href="http://extensions.ckan.org/">http://extensions.ckan.org/</a></h2>
CKAN Extensions are a way to extend and alter the functionality of the base CKAN platform using the numerous extension points provided by CKAN. [CKAN Extensions provide limitless possibilities][ext] from altering the site look and feel to adding site pages, from new validation methods to modifying or adding APIs.

[ext]: http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/

There are currently 100 extensions already listed in the registry based on an initial survey of the extensions available "in the wild" (on github etc), and we will be adding more going forward.

### All About Extensions

[CKAN Extensions][ext] are a way to extend the functionality of the base CKAN platform using the numerous extension points provided by CKAN.

Support for creating CKAN Extensions was first introduced in Autumn 2010 and has been extended multiple times ever since. Until now we have collected lists of extensions on the wiki but with the growing number of Extensions it is useful to have a proper registry (an Extension registry was one of the most requested items in the [Roadmap consultation][roadmap]).

Examples include:

* [Geospatial Extension that adds geospatial capabilities to CKAN][geospatial]
* [DCAT Extension to add a DCAT compliant metadata API to CKAN][dcat]
* [Custom Schemas Extension to provide easy, shareable custom schemas][scheming]
* [Commenting Extension to provide comments on Dataset pages using Disqus][disqus]

[geospatial]: http://extensions.ckan.org/extension/spatial/

[roadmap]: http://ckan.org/2014/10/01/ckan-high-level-roadmap-consultation-autumn-2014/

### Next Steps

At present, the Registry is confined to "functional" extensions which add new functionality to CKAN and are not specific to a given site.

We are considering adding a section for theme oriented and site-specific extensions (e.g. support for metadata specific to a given site) since these extensions may be useful as inspiration and instruction to others even if they are not likely to be directly installed.
