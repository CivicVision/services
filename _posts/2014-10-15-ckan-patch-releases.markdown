We are happy to announce that new patch releases for CKAN 2.0.x, 2.1.x and 2.2.x are now available to download and install.

These patch releases fix important bugs and security issues, so users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch release for the CKAN version they are using.

For a list of the fixes included you can check the CHANGELOG:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/changelog.html#v2-0-5-2014-10-15">2.0.5</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/changelog.html#v2-1-3-2014-10-15">2.1.3</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/changelog.html#v2-2-1-2014-10-15">2.2.1</a></li>
</ul>
Patch release upgrades are very straight-forward and do not contain any backwards incompatible changes or involve any change in the requirements, database or Solr schema. As stated in the <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/upgrading.html#ckan-releases">release policy</a>, the latest patch release is the only one officially supported.

For details on how to upgrade, see the following links depending on your install method:
