      <blockquote>
        <p>The interactive infographics we worked on with Open Knowledge made a big difference to our reportâ€™s online impact. The product allowed us to bring out the key themes of the report in a simple, compelling way. This allowed more people to absorb and share the key messages without having to read the full report, but also drew more people into reading it.</p>
